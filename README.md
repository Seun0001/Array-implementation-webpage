# Array Implementation Webpage

```diff

+ This webpage displays an array as a formatted HTML string. The array is initially hidden, and can be displayed by clicking the "Display Array" button.

+ The array is defined in a `html_webpage.js` file, and is displayed using the `displayArray` and `formatArrayList` functions. The `displayArray` function is called when the "Display Array" button is clicked, and the `formatArrayList` function formats the array as an HTML string.

+ The `html_webpage.js` file also contains a `console.log` statement that logs the array as a string with each value on a new line. This is done using the `map`, `Object.values`, `flat`, and `join` methods.

- The `console.js` file in the `console` folder is not used in this webpage.

+ The `style.css` file contains the styles for the webpage.
